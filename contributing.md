### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Commit your update and create a PR

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process:zap:.
